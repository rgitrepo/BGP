| **AGGREGATOR** <br><br> AGGREGATOR is an optional transitive attribute, which MAY be included in updates that are formed by aggregation (see Section 9.2.2.2). | **AGGREGATOR Overview**: <br><br> - `AGGREGATOR` is an **optional transitive attribute**, meaning it can be included in BGP updates and will propagate across Autonomous Systems (AS). <br> - It is used to identify the BGP speaker (router) that performed the route aggregation. <br><br> **Example**: Router A aggregates two routes (`192.168.1.0/24` and `192.168.2.0/24`) and includes its AS number and IP address as the `AGGREGATOR` attribute in the update. |
| A BGP speaker that performs route aggregation MAY add the AGGREGATOR attribute, which SHALL contain its own AS number and IP address. | **Components of AGGREGATOR**: <br><br> - The `AGGREGATOR` attribute contains: <br> 1. **AS Number**: The AS number of the router performing the aggregation. <br> 2. **IP Address**: The router's IP address. <br><br> **Purpose**: This helps identify the source of the aggregated route, which can be useful for debugging and managing routing policies. <br><br> **Example**: Router A in AS1 aggregates two routes and sets `AGGREGATOR = {AS1, 172.16.0.1}`. Other routers know that AS1 aggregated this route and can trace it back to Router A. |
| The IP address SHOULD be the same as the BGP Identifier of the speaker. | **IP Address and BGP Identifier**: <br><br> - The IP address in the `AGGREGATOR` attribute should match the **BGP Identifier** of the router (a unique value for the router in BGP operations). <br> - This ensures consistency and simplifies identifying the originating router. <br><br> **Example**: Router A with BGP Identifier `10.0.0.1` performs aggregation. It sets `AGGREGATOR = {AS1, 10.0.0.1}`, matching its BGP Identifier to ensure accurate traceability. |
