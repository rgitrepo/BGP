| **5.1.1. ORIGIN** <br> ORIGIN is a well-known mandatory attribute. The ORIGIN attribute is generated by the speaker that originates the associated routing information. Its value SHOULD NOT be changed by any other speaker. | **ORIGIN Attribute**: <br> - The `ORIGIN` attribute is a **well-known mandatory attribute**, meaning it must be included in all BGP UPDATE messages containing NLRI. <br> <br> - It indicates the **origin of the route**, providing information about how the route was learned. For instance, the route could be: <br> **1. IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol)**: Learned through an internal protocol such as OSPF. <br> **2. EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)**: Learned through the legacy EGP protocol. <br> **3. INCOMPLETE**: The origin is undefined, such as when a route is redistributed from another source. <br> <br> - The `ORIGIN` value is set by the **router that originates** the routing information. Once set, **it should not be modified** by other routers in the BGP network to ensure route integrity. <br> <br> **Practical Examples**: <br> **Example 1**: Router A originates a route `192.168.1.0/24` via OSPF. It advertises the route in BGP with `ORIGIN = IGP`. All routers that receive this route will recognize it as originating from an internal protocol and retain this `ORIGIN` value. <br> <br> **Example 2**: Router B redistributes a route `10.0.0.0/8` from a static route into BGP. Since the origin is unknown, Router B sets `ORIGIN = INCOMPLETE`. Other routers receiving this route will treat the origin as undefined but still use the route if no better alternative exists. <br> <br> **Example 3**: Router C learns a route `172.16.0.0/16` from an external peer running the legacy EGP protocol. Router C sets `ORIGIN = EGP` when advertising it to other peers. The `ORIGIN` remains `EGP` throughout the network unless explicitly changed, which is discouraged. |

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Definitions Added**: Detailed explanation of the `ORIGIN` attribute and its significance in BGP routing.
2. **Examples Enhanced**: Real-world scenarios provided for different `ORIGIN` values (`IGP`, `EGP`, and `INCOMPLETE`).
3. **Clarity Maintained**: Easy-to-read structure with line spacing for better visualization.
